The start is very simple, use coins to buy buildings and upgrades that produce even more coins! Keep doing it until you can do the next feature, you will know when you can see it. :)
    However, also take the time to look at the name itself, synergism, it ain't there just for the looks! Starting with the first coin upgrade, note that it says "producers" and not just workers! This means that you can buy other producers to directly improve your coin gain! This is really the core of the entire game, so remember this!

    Congrats! You have <span style='color:skyblue'>Prestiged!</span>
    Prestiging for the first time unlocks the Diamond layer, which consists of Diamond buildings, Diamond upgrades, Automation upgrades (for your QoL needs), Generator upgrades (powerful), and last but not least<span style='color:skyblue'><b> RUNES</b></span>!
    <span style='color:skyblue'>Runes</span> will be talked about in a different section.
    The Diamond upgrades themselves are pretty decent, but a good amount of boost comes from the <span style='color:skyblue'>Diamond buildings!</span> Once bought,the first tier will make crystals which will boost coin production and every tier after will produce the tier before.
    The final item unlocked is a new "prestige" layer, <span style='color:skyblue'>accelerator boosts!</span> They will reset Diamond upgrades and your Diamonds (<b>NOT GENERATOR UPGRADES, AUTOMATION, or DIAMOND BUILDINGS</b>) in exchange for a boost to your accelerators. This can be useful to boost your progress if stuck.
    Since they don't reset diamond buildings and some upgrades, before doing the reset you should spend most of your diamonds on them, this<b> spend before you reset </b>pops up a lot in the game, so make sure to do it on things that don't reset!

    \n<span style='color:yellow'> Spirits</span> essentially act the same way as<span style='color:skyblue'> Blessings</span>, with only 1 major change, the more<span style='color:red'> corruptions</span> you have, the<span style='color:lime'> stronger</span> they get!
    However, they are a lot more <span style='color:red'>expensive</span> than<span style='color:skyblue'> Blessings</span>, so you most likely won't be able to get any once you first unlock them. I recommend grinding a bit first before trying to grind Spirits.
    Speed Spirit and Duplication Spirit give you tons of value for them giving even more global speed and more <span style='color:gold'>Wow! Cubes</span>, which you need a lot of. Thrift Spirit also gives decent value, with it boosting<span style='color:steelblue'> obtanium</span>. Superior Intellect Spirit gives ok value when you first unlock Spirits, but quickly loses value. Finally, Prism Spirit has next to no value, so use the last of your<span style='color:yellow'> offerings</span> on it.

    The more <span style='color:skyblue'>Blessing power</span> a Blessing has, the stronger it is! Blessing power is boosted by the <span style='color:skyblue'>Blessing level</span> itself,<span style='color:steelblue'> some researches</span> but also NON-FREE RUNE LEVELS!
    The rune level of a particular rune boosts that respective Blessing's power (speed rune boosts speed Blessing).
    Most value would probably be Speed Blessing and Prism Blessing as they both boost <span style='color:crimson'>ant sacrifice rewards</span>! Superior Intellect Blessing is also useful as it boosts<span style='color:crimson'> ant speed</span>, but the other 2 should be upgraded if you have extra offerings.

    <span style='color:yellow'><b>Talismans</b></span> give<span style='color:skyblue'> extra rune levels</span> basically to 3 runes. You gain different talismans from completing x25 of each reincarnation challenge, getting to 1e100 crumbs, and buying one of them from shop.
    There are 3 ways to change and/or buff talismans:

    <b>FORTIFY</b>: The simplest of all, use <span style='color:yellow'>talisman fragments and shards</span> (Either bought or gotten from sacrificing above certain elo) to boost the amount of bonus<span style='color:skyblue'> rune</span> levels the talisman gives.

    <b>ENHANCE</b>: Increase the max capacity of fortifies to a talisman, increase the base rune level per fortify, and increase the enhance bonus (example enhancing exemption reduces taxes by 10% each time).

    <b>RESPEC</b>: This is the one that gets literally almost everyone tripped up, so listen up! Remember how I said that talismans give free rune levels to 3 runes, using <b>respec</b> allows you to change those runes that they boost (with a small offering cost that is very negligible). Always make sure to use respec all, as it’s better to respec them all to the same 3 than to go in the middle and boost all separately. Also, make sure to respec them to the things you want to grind (use SI for grinding ants for example.)

    When used on a rune, they get transfered into <span style='color:gold'>rune exp</span>, which with enough rune exp you can level a rune and gain <span style='color:lime'>powerful bonuses!</span> Check each specific rune for the details on the boosts they give!
    Runes are unlocked mostly via achievements so keep an eye out for new runes that can give different buffs (but more expensive...).
    Rune recycle chance is a chance to recycle an offering so it isn't used which gives a multi to rune exp! More rune exp, more fun!

    I know you are getting <span style='color:red'>tired</span> of reading about all of these challenges, I'm tired too, but this one is <b>really important</b>.
    Challenge 15 is a very <i>special</i> type of ascension challenge; it is made to be<span style='color:red'> impossible</span> to complete.
    However, the further you get in challenge 15, the more <span style='color:lime'>bonuses</span> you unlock and the <span style='color:lime'>stronger</span> those bonuses get!
    You can check the bonuses in the <b>"Challenge 15/Platonic Upgrades"</b> subtab of "<span style='color:gold'>Wow! Cubes</span>".
    <span style=font-size:30px><i>STRATEGY:</i></span>
    Think about this, at the beginning every<span style='color:lime'> reincarnation</span> done in c15 will grant you <b>1</b> obtainium, due to the <span style='color:red'>obtainium decrease </span>from corruptions, so <i>is there any way to gain obtainium fast in c15?</i>
    Remember, exiting and entering <span style='color:lime'>reincarnation challenges</span> does a <b>force-reincarnation</b> which grants you <b>1</b> obtanium. Maybe with the tools we have we can <span style='color:yellow'>enter</span> those challenges and <span style='color:yellow'>exit them very fast</span> to gain <span style='color:steelblue'> meaningful obtanium</span>? (<b>Timers set to 0 seconds will do them every frame!</b>)
    The main<span style='color:lime'> boost</span> in c15 is believe it or not<span style='color:skyblue'> crystals</span>, which means that <span style='color:skyblue'><b>PRISM</b></span>, the arguably worst rune, is one of the<span style='color:lime'> best</span> runes in c15, and that<span style='color:steelblue'> researches</span> that boost rune effectiveness or crystals are the only ones that are really gonna be able to do anything.

    There are some periods in c15 where you can gain<span style='color:yellow'> insane coin exponent</span> gains in a short amount of time. For the sake of brevity we will call them "<i>booms</i>". One boom will occur once you reach<span style='color:lime'> e30k particles</span> (far away but you will get there) where you immediatly jump to<span style='color:lime'><b> e200k particles</b></span>!!! Why? Platonic and others sure don't know.
    The other two relates to <b>talismans</b> and the other relates to a completion of a <b>challenge</b>, I think you can figure out the specifics on your own. :)
    You shouldn't grind ages for these booms, but it is nice to know if you are close to one to try to go for it.
    That's basically all you need to know about c15, in between your <span style='color:gold'>cube</span> grinds and other grinds it's a good idea to do c15 every once in a while to<span style='color:lime'> boost your gains</span>!

    Unlike previous challenges, ascension challenges all have a<b> requirement of C10</b> (Challenge 10) completions.

    Damn you gotta be thinking how many reset tiers are left...
    Anyway, welcome to Reincarnation! Your previous progress can't reincarnate with you, but in exchange for them you gain particles, obtainium, and offerings!
    Obtainium is used for RESEARCH, talked about in their own section.
    Offerings are used for runes which you already know.
    Particles, like mythos and diamonds before it, are used for automation, particle buidlings, and particle upgrades! Note how you need to unlock particle upgrades first via research. Research makes the world go round!
    Unlike the previous tiers, reincarnating does not do that much on its own, but you want to keep your reincarnation building count as high as you can. So just remember to do it whenever you can make significant gains. You'll also find that the pace between reincarnations can vary a lot - you may want some really long ones and others as quick as possible. This may or may not be useful later...
    Reincarnating for the first time also unlocks the SHOP where you can finally spend your well earned quarks, check the respective section for more info!
